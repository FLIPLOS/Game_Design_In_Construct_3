# The Construct 3 Example Browser

We've already taken a look at the example browser in a previous module, but now we're going to dive a little more deeply into it to see what sorts of games are possible in Construct 3. Later in this unit, you're going to be creating a mini, prototype game based off of modifying one of these examples. Use today as an exploratory hour to browse through as many types of games as possible to find an example that may interest you to build/modify. 

## Today's Exploratory Task

Your mini-game will be a remix of one of these games. Your task today is to find a game you'd like to modify. Stretch your horizons, your first choice is not always the best (maybe something more interesting exists, or maybe you don't know how the code works). 

For each game you explore:
1. Play through the game. See if the gameplay interests you.
If interesting:
    - Read through the code and code comments, see if you can understand how the game's logic functions. If you don't, ask a friend or a teacher to help. 
    - If you can understand (mostly) how the game's logic works, make a note of this game as a potential candidate for your mini-game. 
else:
    - If both of the above conditions are false, move on to a different game to test. 
    
Try to play at least 5 games today. 

## Finding Examples
1. Navigate to [editor.construct.net](https://editor.construct.net) and select the example browser.

2. Look at the "filters" panel on the left. You'll want to conduct your search in 2 categories (independent search, not together)
    - "Barebones Template"
        - This is my preferred section for you to browse today. Examples are simpler and the code is easier to understand. The game is also a better fit for a *MINI* game. 
    - "Reccomended"
        - You may also look at this section, however, the games here are significantly more advanced to create and have much more complex code. While they may be fun to play, you also have to understand how they're programmed (by reading comments & code) in order to be able to modify them. *If you don't understand how the game functions, you should not choose this game to modify*. Consider this your warning. 
    - Other tags
        - You are more than welcome to browse other tags, but be warned, the code tends to be incredibly complex and is understandably not realistic for a mini game. 
        
3. Play through at least 5 different games. You have one hour to complete this task. 
 
This repository takes construct 3 tutorials available from www.construct.net (that use CC licenses) modifies, restructures, comments project code to be easier to read and better in line with a High School game design course. This repository (likely) requires a paid construct 3 license.
