# Game Design In Construct 3
 
This repository takes construct 3 tutorials available from www.construct.net (that use CC licenses) modifies, restructures, comments project code to be easier to read and better in line with a High School game design course. This repository (likely) requires a paid construct 3 license. 

# How to use this Repository

The Module folders that are intended to be completed in sequential order. Inside each module:
1. Download the game_assets folder (if included)
2. Open the initial .c3p file in construct 3, and play through the game to see an example of a finished project. Some of your projects may turn out differently. 
3. Begin with the "intial project tutorial" on the README.md for the module's page. Some projects require you to create a new blank project, other projects allow you to download the * *_Construct_Folder* as a starter project that you will build upon. 
5. Open the www.construct.net tutorial, or follow the tutorial inside the README.md for the module. Follow through the steps in your  project. 
6. When the tutorial is complete, open the "extension_project" folder (if included) and test the extension .c3p project. How might you extend functionality in your intial game? Use these suggested extensions as starting points for what to change in your own project. 
7. Once completed the main module tutorial, complete the self assessment google form. The form will not grade for correct answers, due to text-validation errors. However, a correct answer is provided for you below. Self-assess; if your answers are incorrect, your knowledge is below what is required for the next module. Go back through and re-complete the sections of the module that are unclear to you. 

# Repository Structure

Each Module folder includes:
1. A README.md
- this includes either a tutorial hyperlink, or a built in tutorial. 
- "By the end of this tutorial, you should know:" programing concepts you should be aware of before moving forward
- a self-assessment google form on the tutorial's content. complete this after the tutorial 

2. the intial tutorial project 
- a .c3p file for testing the final project created
- a construct 3 "folder project". This needs to be opened in construct 3 as a "local folder" by selecting the folder "X_construct_folder" file. 

3. game_assets
- all initial assets used (does not include extension project assets) 

4. extension_project
- .c3p file for testing the final extension project created
- a construct 3 "folder project". This needs to be opened in construct 3 as a "local folder" by selecting the folder "X_construct_folder" file.
