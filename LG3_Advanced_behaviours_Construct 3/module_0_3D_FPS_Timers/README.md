# Making a 3D FPS
We're now going to explore a 3D styled game, a throwback to the days of Doom, if you've ever played. Construct 3's 3D engine capabilities are not near as powerful as it's 2D abilites, and even though it does have 3D capabilities, it is more of a "3D" game. In any case, we'll learn about a new example bare-bones game that you can build off of to make your own 3D FPS, and about timers, a generalized behaviour that we can apply to any of our games to make time-based events.

## By the end of this tutorial you should know:
1. How a 3D object is presented in construct 3
2. What a *timer* behaviour is
3. How to use *timers* to create in-game, timebased powerup events


# Tutorial
We're going to build upon one of construct 3's "barebones templates" in the example browser today. 

1. Navigate back to the example browser at [editor.construct.net](https://editor.construct.net) and select "barebones template" as a
