# Accessing All Features of Construct 3
Well done designer, you've successfully completed your first (simple) game. Now it's time to save this work so we don't lose it. 

## By the end of this module you should know:
1. How to access all features on construct 3.

# Tutorial

## Paid Access Code
As Construct 3 is a paid game engine, many of the features are "locked" away for you. Thankfully, ASH has purchased an access code for you. You may need  to enter this code each time you open construct 3, so store this code in a safe place. As this is a public website, the actual access code will be on the "Activity Feed" in Brightspace. These are the steps you use to enter the code. 

1. When on editor.construct.net, in the top right corner, under the account menu, select "Enter access code"

2. This brings up the access code window where users can input the code found on the BrightSpace Activity Feed.

3. If the code is recognised as active, the user will have access to the full version of Construct 3.

If a code is not recognised, Construct 3 will show a warning. Usually, it's a case of being typed in wrong. If not, see Mr. Pratt
