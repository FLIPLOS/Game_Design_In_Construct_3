# Cloning Repos

Another great thing about Github is the ability to clone repos. Essentially, you can take someone elses code base, and "clone" it to your own github account/computer. This repo that you're currently working on can be cloned and added to your own computer. Later on in Learning Guide 1, you will be using many of these games inside this repo as a template for your own games, and you'll need to have local access to the different sprite sheets & game engine files for your own work. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have all the necessary files you'll need to create games in Learning Guide 1. 

## Cloning this Repo

1. In your documents folder on your computer, make a new folder called "game_design_tutorials". Do NOT make this folder inside your current repo, it should be a new top level folder.  
2. In GitHub Desktop, add a new Repo.
3. Select "Clone Repositoryâ€¦" and insert this URL 

`https://github.com/MrPrattASH/Game_Design_In_Construct_3`

4. Select a the game_design_tutorials local path for your cloned repo inside your Documents. 
5. Select "clone". 
6. Let's take a look at what you just cloned. You should now have access to all of these files in this current repo, locally on your computer. (Menu bar, Repository > Show in Finder). See if you can find a bullet, hero, monster, and explosion picture inside "LG1_Using_Construct3 > module_1.0_ghost_shooter > game_assets". You're going to need to copy/paste these files inside your repo.

## Setting your Repo up for your first game
We're now going to prepare your repo for the creation of your first game (the start of Learning Guide 1). You'll need these files on your personal repo to be able to start learning guide 1. 

1. Inside Github Desktop, select your game design repo. (Top left, select current repository, then your repo under your username, not under MRPrattASH.)

2. Reveal your repo's location in Finder, then add a new folder called "Game 1 Ghost Shooter". You'll use this folder to store *all* game related content for the game #1. Inside this folder, create 2 sub-folders. 
* Construct_folder (where we will store our game engine files later)
* game_assets (where we will store all of our artwork for this game)

3. Inside the game assets sub-folder, copy and paste in all of the png images from step 6 above (the bullet, hero, monster, explosion, and cracked ground image). You need to copy/paste in these files to your own personal repo, as you cannot make file changes on the MrPrattASH repo. (You can change this repo on your local computer, but it won't change on remote, because it is MrPrattASH's repo, not your repo). Later on in the course you will need to copy more content from this repo, and I suggest you copy/paste that content again, rather that re-writing the local file paths.

From now on, everytime you begin to create a new game (of which you'll make several throughout the course of Game Design) you need to:
* make a top level folder with your game title
* make 2 sub-folders. 
  * game assets
  * construct folder

If you don't heed this warning, your files will be unorganized and you may overwrite/lose work accidentally. Follow this structure for the rest of the course.
