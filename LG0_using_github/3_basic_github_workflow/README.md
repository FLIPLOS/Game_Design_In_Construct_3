# Basic Github Workflow

We'll use Github close to every class in this course for a few purposes:
1. It is an online backup of our work so we never lose any days of programming, designing, etc. 
2. It is a way of keeping track of our file changes over time, so we can "go back in time" to see what we've done, as well as restore any files we may have deleted by accident. 
3. It is an industry standard tool, so it is important to know how to use technology that real game designers use every day.

While we won't use every feature of github (no need for "branches") this will be our basic workflow for using Github in this course: (all steps will be further explained later on)

1. Make changes to your local computer file folders. This could be things like:
* adding new files to your folders such as:
  * character sprites
  * level backdrops
  * music and sounds
  * word docs with story lines
  * text-based code files
  * construct 3 game-engine files & folders
* renaming files or folders
* editing current existing files
* re-ordering and moving files to new locations
* deleting files 

It's important to note that we are only changing files LOCALLY on our computer, this does NOT automatically make changes to your REMOTE version (cloud saved) of your Github repo.
